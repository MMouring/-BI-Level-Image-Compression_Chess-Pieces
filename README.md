## Background ##
This is a research project I did back in 2015-2016 while in University with a professor of mine, Dr. Khal Dhou. I wrote this source code to produce reduce BI-LEVEL images into directional movements patterns which were then compressed by reducing the string size of repeated and patterned characters. This particular compression algorithm is a follow up to the published Ant Colonies work we did. It simulates the movement of two chess pieces, the *Rook* and the *Bishop*.

## Reason for Upload ##
This was a decent project that showed early, promising results but we were not able to complete the project due to time constraints. I have uploaded it with the intent to refactor the project to be engineered more efficiently and asthetically. (I like clean code).
